This folder contains data on equilibrium and non-equilibrium partitioning
of coffee aromas (volatile organic compounds) into an enclosed headspace, from
roast and ground coffee, at different temperatures. These data can be used
to estimate equilibrium partitioning coefficients, activation energies and 
diffusivities for these compounds in coffee.
