  fill_levels.csv

This gives data on the concentration (in parts per billion) in the head-space 
for different volatile organic compounds. The measurements are taken using 
PTR-MS-ToF, and the experimental setup is that a mass of roast and ground 
coffee is placed in a glass jar of volume 3.466 litres, and the system is
allowed time to come close to equilibrium. That is to say, the concentrations 
relate to late times, when the measured concentration for each chamical
has reached a plateau value. All data are collected at 20 degrees Celsius, 
but use different masses of coffee in the jar.


Each column from the second onwards has the following format:

  The top row is ithe name of the chemical measured.

  The second row is its molecular mass in Daltons.

  Rows 4 to 12 contain the (near-) equilibrium concentration of the
  volatile organic compound (in parts per billion, as indicated
  in row 3).

Column 1 has a different format, with rows 4 to 12 showing the mass of
roast and ground coffee (in grams) placed in the jar for the experiment.
